*
* Dear Contributor,
*
* In order to ensure this project remains completely free and unencumbered by
* anyone's copyright monopoly, it is advisable that you dedicate your code-base
* contributions to the three licensing terms above. This removes any possible
* ambiguity as to what terms somebody might have thought they were contributing
* under, in case of a future dispute. These concerns are not unique to public
* domain software. Most large, established open-source projects have a
* Contributor License Agreement (CLA) process, of varying degrees of formality.
*
* Please add yourself to the list below before contributing.
* Thanks.
