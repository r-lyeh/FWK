# GLSLCC linter for Visual Studio Code

This extension is actually a slightly modified version of [vscode-glsllint](https://github.com/hsimpson/vscode-glsllint). 

## Building and installing the extension

Get the modified fork from [here](https://github.com/septag/vscode-glsllint/tree/glslcc-support). 

And then just follow the instructions [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/working-with-extensions/publishing-extension), or in short:

- Install node.js 14
- Install vsce `npm install -g vsce`
- Package `vsce package`
- Install the extension in vscode manually
